# Task Action Planner (TAP)
- [ ] Create Task Action Planner to break down tasks into smaller tasks (if required)
- - [ ] Fine-tune Small Language Model (SLM)

# Classifier
- [ ] Add classifier for task complexity: Easy, Medium, Hard

# NearestNeighbour
- [ ] Add logic for task complexity when classifier is made

# Execution loop
- [ ] Create logic to create order in which sub-tasks are executed

# Benchmarks
- [ ] Add benchmarks
- [ ] Create script to automatically run benchmarks

# Dataset
- [ ] Create dataset to train classifier for Task Classification
- [ ] Create dataset to fine-tune TAP:SLM (Task Action Planner: Small Language Model)
